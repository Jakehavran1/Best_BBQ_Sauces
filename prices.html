   <p>Some might say our prices are cheap and some may also say it is expensive. As a company, we think our prices are valued at the perfect price and we want to lower the prices in the future. If you join our VIP CLub, you get cheaper sauce prices and other benefits that nobody else can have. We do have samples in our store that we would love for you to take home and try out. We want to give the customers every chance to get any flavor they want!</p>
