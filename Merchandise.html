     <p> We offer merchandise because we want you to represent our brand every single day. Whether that is a sheatshirt or shirt outside, or showing your gear off on social media. Gift cards are also a great way for YOU to earn points, even if the gift is for somebody else! It is our honor to give you benefits if you show support for us on a daily basis. We also have a feature in our store that calculates how much money you have spent here in total in our store. Because it is a running total, it could change any hour on any day. We do that for the top 10 people that have spent the most money. We love to see it and so does our customers. </p>
      <p> Come on down and visit us and get your rewards today! </p>
